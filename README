Summary: We are going to simulate the writing of logs.
	In a nutshell, the problem can be specified as
	follows:
	There is a process who reads from a single text
	file, picks up the next line of text, and puts
	it in a single buffer. Let there be five buffers
	and our producer process keeps on trying to fill
	those five buffers. Then, this process sets a flag
	to indicate that one of the five buffers is full.
	The process can write into a buffer only if the 
	buffer is empty. There are a number of other 
	processes (consumers) who keep on looking for a
	buffer to become full. One of these processes 
	should be able to pick up the text in the buffer
	and write it into the log file. The process must
	make sure that the file is not opened by another
	process for writing.
